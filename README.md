## Description

If you need to replace some of your drapery rods, you might be interested in this app that lets you create custom curtain rods that fit your windows perfectly. You can print them at home using your 3D printer and save money and time.

This app is designed for the custom metal or iron curtain rods that are widely used. You can adjust the dimensions of the model to match your existing rods, or create a new style for your curtains. The app also allows you to choose different options for printing, such as adding support or cutting off part of the side.

The STL files that are included are examples of one type of rod that I used in my house. You might find them useful, or you can generate your own drapery rod models with different measurements. Just use a calliper to get the exact size of your rods and enter them in the app.

I recommend printing the models using the easy Print option enabled, which adds support and chops off part of the side. This makes them easier to print without any problems. You don't need to worry about the roundness, as they will still work fine and no one will notice.

The orientation of the model is important for the strength and durability of the printed rods. Make sure you print them as they are shown in the STL files. You can use different materials for printing, but I suggest using nylon or PETG, as they have good strength and low friction. Avoid PLA and ABS, as they might break or crack over time, especially if they are exposed to sunlight.

This app is a simple and convenient way to make custom curtain rods for your home. You can print as many as you need and enjoy your curtains without any hassle.


### Print settings

Use a iron powder at 1.3Â mm layers to improve strength for the strongest rod.
